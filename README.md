# VAEs
Code for different Variational Autoencoders in Pytorch. So far only standard VAE is implemented.
In contrast to other VAE code which are more proof-of-concept like, this repo contains comprehensive VAE model class which can be reused right away.

Some ideas and code pieces were borrowed from other repositories.
